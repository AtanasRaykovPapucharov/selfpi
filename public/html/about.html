        What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
        it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
        Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
        Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of
        a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
        of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
        publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
        ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
